            <h3>Why is it important to pick the right kind of anime to start with?</h3>
            <p>One thing that always bothers me when people recommend an anime to someone who has never seen anime before,
                is that they never take into consideration if that show is suitable for someone who isn't already familiar with anime or Japanese culture.
                <p>Anime can contain certain tropes, or what I refer to as "anime BS", that can be offputting for someone who isn't as used to that sort of thing yet as they are.
                If you recommend an anime that will just make a new watcher uncomfortable, it could end up in them writing off anime for good.</p>

            <p> Because of this I believe it is important to introduce a new watcher to a kind of anime that contains little or any of this 'anime BS',
                nor any other anime tropes that certain shows have.</p>
                <p>That is where this guide comes in. Here you will find my recommendations for every genre, that I believe will be the most enjoyable for most people
                willing to try to indulge themselves in anime.

            <h3>What can you expect?</h3>
            <p>In this guide you will find my top two picks for the best anime in each genre for a first time watcher to start with.
                I'm going to cover the following categories:
                    <ul>
                        <li><h4><a href="blind_pick.html">Blind pick</a></h4></li>
                        <p>These are the anime I believe will appeal to pretty much anyone, and are the ones I would recommend if you have absolutely no idea what to begin with.
                        </p>
                        <li><h4><a href="action.html">Action</a></h4></li>
                        <p>In action stories, the focus is on thrilling and intense action sequences. Conflicts between characters are often resolved through physical power. While the overall plot may involve groups pitted against each other, the narrative in action stories zooms in on the individual characters, their strengths, weaknesses, and the personal battles they face against members of the opposing group.</p>
                        <li><h4><a href="psychological.html">Psychological</a></h4></li>
                        <p>Psychological stories dive deep into the inner lives of characters, focusing on their thoughts, emotions, and motivations. The narrative style explores the reasons behind their actions, driving the plot and unraveling the story.</p>
                        <li><h4><a href="scifi.html">Sci-Fi</a></h4></li>
                        <p>Sci-fi stories usually explore imaginative and futuristic ideas like advanced science, technology, space exploration, time travel, parallel universes, and even the possibility of extraterrestrial life</p>
                        <li><h4><a href="romance.html">Romance</a></h4></li>
                        <p>Romance stories are a type of genre fiction that puts the spotlight on the love and relationship between two people. They often have a heartwarming and optimistic ending that leaves us feeling emotionally fulfilled, but this is not the case for every story..</p>
                        <li><h4><a href="fantasy.html">Fantasy</a></h4></li>
                        <p>Fantasy stories often have magic and other supernatural things as important parts of the story. They can take place in made-up worlds where magic is a normal thing.</p>
                        <li><h4><a href="comedy.html">Comedy</a></h4></li>
                        <p>The main focus of comedy stories is to make the audience feel good and bring out positive emotions. They aim to make us laugh, be amused, and entertained. Comedy stories often have episodic structures or conclude with happy endings.</p>
                    </ul>
