            <p>Mitsuha Miyamizu, a high school girl, yearns to live the life of a boy in the bustling city of Tokyo—a
                dream that stands in stark contrast to her present life in the countryside.
                Meanwhile in the city, Taki Tachibana lives a busy life as a high school student while juggling his
                part-time job and hopes for a future in architecture.
            </p>
            <p>One day, Mitsuha awakens in a room that is not her own and suddenly finds herself living the dream life
                in Tokyo—but in Taki's body!
                Elsewhere, Taki finds himself living Mitsuha's life in the humble countryside. In pursuit of an answer
                to this strange phenomenon, they begin to search for one another.
            </p>
            <p>Kimi no Na wa. revolves around Mitsuha and Taki's actions, which begin to have a dramatic impact on each
                other's lives, weaving them into a fabric held together by fate and circumstance.</p>

                        <h4>Your Lie in April</h4>
                        <p>Original title: 'Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso' ('April is your lie' in Japanese)</p>
                        <p>Directed by: Kyōhei Ishiguro</p>
                        <p>Written by: Takao Yoshioka</p>
                        <p class="yournamedescription">The manga series originated from a one-shot comic that Arakawa entered in a competition; he based the series on it and drew inspiration from the existence of musical manga, such as Beck and Nodame Cantabile.
                            A-1 Pictures adapted Your Lie in April into an anime television series that was aired on Fuji TV's Noitamina block from October 2014 to March 2015, and an original video animation (OVA) episode was released in May 2015.
                            A live-action film adaptation of the same name was released in September 2016. Various stage play adaptations have also been produced. - Wikipedia

            <p>Piano prodigy Arima Kousei dominated the competition and all child musicians knew his name. But after his
                mother, who was also his instructor, passed away, he had a mental breakdown while performing at a
                recital.
                This resulted in him no longer being able to hear the sound of his piano playing.
            </p>
            <p>Two years later, Kousei hasn't touched the piano and views the world without any flair or color. He was
                content at living out his life with his good friends Tsubaki and Watari until, one day, a girl changed
                everything.
                Miyazono Kaori is a pretty, free spirited violinist whose playing style reflects her personality. Kaori
                helps Kousei return to the music world and show that it should be free and mold breaking unlike the
                structured and rigid style Kousei was used to.
